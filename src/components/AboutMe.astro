        Hi, I'm yshhuang, a full-stack software developer from China.
        <br />
        My primary tools of choice includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Typescript</li>
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>Ionic</li>
        <li>Astro</li>
        <li>Nextjs</li>

    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      Beyond coding, I'm passionate about design, illustration, animation and 3D modelling and traveling.
      An unusual hobby of mine is collecting vintage passports, they're
      interesting pieces of history to me.

      While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the
      job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right
      solution for each project.
